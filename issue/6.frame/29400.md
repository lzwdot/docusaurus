# react-router 如何配置懒加载

```js
import React, {Suspense, lazy} from "react";
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route} from "react-router-dom";

const Home = lazy(() => import('./routes/Home'))
const About = lazy(() => import('./routes/About'))
const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home}></Route>
        <Route path="/about" component={About}></Route>
      </Switch>
    </Suspense>
  </Router>
)
```
