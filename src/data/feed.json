Pan analytics package. Developer Lukas Mateffy has quickly capitalized on this momentum by creating a small and helpful Laravel package called Pan Analytics Viewer. This package enables you to view your panphp/pan analytics directly in the UI where they are triggered without needing to run the cli command.\nTo install this package, run:\ncomposer require mateffy/pan-analytics-viewer\n\nThen, to add the popups to your app, all you have to do is include the pan-analytics::viewer component to your blade template.\n@if (auth()->user()?->can('view-analytics'))\n    <x-pan-analytics::viewer />\n@endif\n\nOnce that is added, you should have access to view the analytics of any element that has a [data-pan] attribute when you hover over the element.\nNote: You will want to ensure you only render this component for users with the necessary permissions as this component will expose the analytics data collected by pan.\nLearn more about this package and view the source code on GitHub at Capevace/pan-analytics-viewer.\nThe post Pan Analytics Viewer appeared first on Laravel News.\nJoin the Laravel Newsletter to get Laravel articles like this directly in your inbox.","pubDate":"2024-10-22"},{"title":"Laravel performance monitoring in Honeybadger","link":"https://laravel-news.com/honeybadger-laravel-performance-monitoring","description":"Great news, Laravel friends! You can now monitor the performance of your Laravel apps with Honeybadger.\nYes, you read that right: Laravel performance monitoring in Honeybadger! Many of you have asked for this, and we're excited to tell you about it.\nEarlier this year, we launched Honeybadger Insights, a new logging and performance monitoring tool bundled with Honeybadger. Insights allows you to query your logs and events to diagnose performance issues, perform root-cause analyses, and create charts and dashboards to see what's happening in real time. It also works automatically with Honeybadger‚Äôs best-in-class error tracking, unlocking direct access to query and analyze your error data.\nToday, we‚Äôre turning Insights up a notch with two new features just for Laravel developers:\nA new Laravel performance dashboard. Instead of creating a dashboard from scratch,  select ‚Äú Laravel‚Äù from our list of curated monitoring dashboards. The new dashboard allows you to monitor requests and background jobs, slow requests and queries, and more.\nLaravel performance instrumentation. Our composer package now automatically sends performance events and metrics from Laravel. The new instrumentation is what powers your dashboard, but you can also use our query language‚ÄîBadgerQL‚Äîto dig into the data yourself.\nThe Laravel Performance Dashboard\nWhen¬†creating a dashboard¬†in Honeybadger, you have several options. To get started, select the new ‚Äú Laravel‚Äù dashboard from the list:\n\nOur team curates each dashboard to make it easy for you to ramp up with Honeybadger and¬†BadgerQL. Install a monitoring integration (such as our composer package), select the matching dashboard, and you're done.\nWe recently deployed a production Laravel app at Honeybadger (Statamic, it‚Äôs fantastic!). Here‚Äôs what our dashboard looks like:\n\nHoneybadger‚Äôs new Laravel Performance Dashboard\nThe new Laravel dashboard includes the following widgets by default:\nRequest counts ‚Äî A line chart of the number of requests to your Laravel app over time. Know immediately when you have a spike and when traffic is steady.\nResponse distributions ‚Äî A bar chart that shows the response distributions binned by 100ms. See how a majority of your requests are performing.\nJob durations ‚Äî A line chart showing the average duration for each of your Laravel jobs. Helps you keep the processing pipeline optimized.\nResponses ‚Äî A line chart showing the number of responses grouped by status code. Are you having a spike in 403 Forbidden responses? This chart will tell you about it.\nSlowest controllers ‚Äî Your slowest Laravel controllers, with Apdex scores based on 200ms response times. This table tells you where you can improve performance.\nSlowest 10 requests ‚Äî Your slowest requests by controller and duration. Use the included Request ID to query for events that happened during that request (such as a slow SQL query, N+1 queries, etc.).\nSlowest queries per request ‚Äî Quickly see your slowest queries, including the average & max duration per Request ID.\nSlowest 10 outgoing requests ‚Äî Your slowest outgoing requests, like when you call an external REST API.\nSlowest 10 queries ‚Äî Your slowest SQL queries overall.\nAfter you create a dashboard, you don't have to keep the default widgets‚Äîwe designed Honeybadger dashboards to be customized. In fact, reading the underlying queries is a great way to learn BadgerQL. To see the query and raw data behind any dashboard widget, click \"Open in Query Editor\":\n\nYou can tweak the query, review the results, and update the dashboard from there:\n\nLaravel performance instrumentation\nThe data that feeds the new Laravel Dashboard is sent automatically from the honeybadger-laravel composer package¬†starting in version 4.2.x‚Äîso make sure you upgrade to the latest version. After you upgrade, you'll also need to¬†enable the Honeybadger Insights instrumentation for Laravel¬†by adding the following to your¬†config/honeybadger.php¬†config file:\n  'events' => [\n      'enabled' => true\n  ]\n\nWe'll enable this feature by default in a future package version, but you must opt in for now. After deploying the new Laravel config, some new¬†events¬†and¬†metrics¬†will begin to appear in Honeybadger Insights, and your Laravel dashboard will come alive!\n\nWe also added some new configuration and documentation to help you customize the events you care about. To learn more, check out our new¬†Sending Events to Insights¬†guide.\nSending custom events\nYou can also send your own Laravel events to Honeybadger using the¬†Honeybadger.event¬†method:\nHoneybadger.event('user_activity', [\n  'action' => 'registration',\n  'user_id' => 123\n])\n\nThe first argument is the type of the event (event_type), and the second argument is an object containing any additional data you want to include.\nYou can find these events with the following BadgerQL query:\nfields @ts, @preview\n| filter event_type::str == \"user_activity\"\n| filter action::str == \"registration\"\n| sort @ts\n\nSending your Laravel application logs\nHoneybadger‚Äôs approach to logging is ‚ÄúLog everything, ask anything.‚Äù You don‚Äôt always know what information will be helpful when you‚Äôre troubleshooting an outage (or an error). In addition to the performance telemetry that we now record by default, you can send your Laravel application logs to Honeybadger.\nThere are several ways to do this:\nSend your logs from your infrastructure (i.e., your server, Docker containers, etc.)\nUse our Monolog handler\n\n\nUse our Laravel channel driver\n\n\nUsing our channel driver is the simplest way to get started in Laravel. To configure it, add our event driver to your config/logging.php config file:\n    'channels' => [\n'stack' => [\n            'driver' => 'stack',\n            'channels' => ['single', 'honeybadger'],\n            'ignore_exceptions' => false,\n        ],\n        'honeybadger' => [\n            'driver'  => 'custom',\n            'via' => Honeybadger\\HoneybadgerLaravel\\HoneybadgerLogEventDriver::class,\n            'name' => 'honeybadger',\n            'level' => 'info',\n        ],\n    ],\n\nNow you can write log messages as usual with Laravel's log facade, and they'll show up in Honeybadger:\nLog::info('An info message');\nLog::error('An error message with context', [\"some-key\" => \"some-value\"]);\n\nAnd, of course, this also works for Lumen!\nLaravel performance monitoring in Honeybadger\nTo try out the new Laravel performance monitoring features in Honeybadger, all you need to do is sign up for a free Honeybadger account. We include 50MB/day (1.5GB/month) ingest for free, and you can upgrade to a paid plan if you need more. Our pricing is reasonable, too! Honeybadger is almost 8 times cheaper than Papertrail for logging. ü§Ø\nWhew! That was a lot to get through, and we‚Äôre just scratching the surface of our roadmap for performance monitoring in Laravel. Questions or comments?

I think it's really nice if you are using a web browser to test API routes and always get JSON even without setting the Accept header to application/json or using the above middleware:\n// bootstrap/app.php\n\nreturn Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))\n\n    //...\n\n    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {\n        $exceptions->shouldRenderJsonWhen(function (Request $request, Throwable $e) {\n            if ($request->is('api/*')) {\n                return true;\n            }\n\n            return $request->expectsJson();\n        });\n    })->create();\n\nUsing the shouldRenderJsonWhen() method, this code ensures that any exceptions thrown during an API request are rendered as JSON.

It's packed with a huge number of features (such as refactoring and testing tools) that can help you write code quickly and efficiently.\nIt also supports installing plugins so you can extend its functionality and tailor your IDE to your specific needs. One of the most popular plugins (and also one of my personal favourites) for Laravel developers is Laravel Idea.\nIn this article, we're going to take a look at what Laravel Idea is and my favourite features that it offers.\nWhat is Laravel Idea?\nLaravel Idea is a plugin for PhpStorm that adds some really handy features for Laravel developers.\nI've been using it for years and absolutely love it. In fact, it's one of the first things I install whenever I get a new laptop, so I can't recommend it highly enough.\nOne of the things I love about it is how seamlessly it integrates with PhpStorm. It feels like it's a part of PhpStorm itself, rather than a separate plugin, so it fits in really well with my workflow. It blends in so well that I often forget whether a specific feature I'm using is native to PhpStorm or if it's part of Laravel Idea.\nHow Much Does Laravel Idea Cost?\nAt the time of writing this article, Laravel Idea provides two separate plans: \"Personal\" and \"Organization\".\nIf you choose to pay monthly, the Personal plan costs $4.90/month for the first year, $3.90 for the second year, and then $2.90 for the third year onwards. However, if you choose to pay annually, these prices are even lower.\nIf you're not sure whether you want to commit to the plugin yet, there's also a 30-day free trial available. Honestly, I'm willing to bet you'll love it so much that you'll want to keep using it after the trial ends! After you've had access to the features it provides, you'll feel like you're missing a limb without it (or at least that's how I'd feel).\nSince it's a relatively cheap tool for the amount of productivity that it offers, it'll likely be an easy sell to your boss (or whoever holds the purse strings) too.\nHow to Install Laravel Idea\nIt's really simple to get started with using Laravel Idea.\nYou can install it directly from PhpStorm itself. You just need to:\nOpen PhpStorm\nGo to the \"Settings\" menu\nClick on \"Plugins\"\nSearch for \"Laravel Idea\"\nClick \"Install\"\nThat's it! It should now be installed and ready to start using.\nTo check whether it's installed, you can look out for the new \"Laravel\" menu item that should be available in the top menu bar. It's from this menu that you can access all the Laravel Idea features.\n\nTop Laravel Idea Features\nThere are a ton of features that Laravel Idea offers, but here are some of my favourites:\nImproved Auto-Complete for PhpStorm\nBy far, one of my favourite features of Laravel Idea is the improved auto-complete that it provides for PhpStorm. Don't get me wrong, the auto-complete in PhpStorm is already really good, but Laravel Idea takes it to the next level.\nIf you're a Laravel developer, you'll already know that Laravel is full of magic. For example, there are Eloquent model accessors, facades, macros, event and job dispatch calls, and so on. Although PhpStorm has a good attempt at understanding some of the more obvious Laravel features, it tends to miss out on these types of magic.\nIn PhpStorm, you can navigate to the new \"Laravel\" menu item and then press \"Generate Helper Code\". Behind the scenes, Laravel Idea will generate helper code by scanning your Laravel application, including reading the migration files and database schema. From here, it's then able to provide much better auto-complete suggestions to PhpStorm. This is something I run regularly (usually after updating dependencies, or after creating new migrations) to keep PhpStorm up-to-date with my Laravel application.\nAs well as this, Laravel Idea can provide PhpStorm with auto-complete suggestions for config and translation keys, route names, view names, form request fields, and so on.\nFor instance, say you have the following form request:\nnamespace App\\Http\\Requests;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Http\\FormRequest;\n\nclass StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest\n{\n    // ...\n\n    public function rules(): array\n    {\n        return [\n            'email' => ['string', 'required', 'email'],\n            'name' => ['string', 'required'],\n        ];\n    }\n}\n\nThen say you wanted to use this form request in a controller like so:\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse App\\Http\\Requests\\StoreUserRequest;\nuse App\\Models\\User;\n\nclass UserController\n{\n    public function store(StoreUserRequest $request)\n    {\n        $email = $request->validated('email');\n    \n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nWhen using code such as $request->validated() and $request->safe(), Laravel Idea will provide auto-complete suggestions for the fields that are available in the form request. For example, typing $request->validated('e') would suggest $request->validated('email') for you. This is a really handy feature that can save you a lot of time and reduce the chances of typos. Here's an example of what this looks like:\n\nCode Generation\nAnother really handy feature which Laravel Idea provides is the ability to generate classes and files with ease.\nYou can either navigate to the \"Laravel\" menu item and then click on \"Code Generation\", or you can use the keyboard shortcut (Cmd + Shift + ,) to bring up the code generation dialog. From here, you can start typing what you want to generate. For example, you can type \"cont\" and the plugin will suggest \"Create Controller\" and \"Create Resource Controller\". You can select one of these and press Enter to generate the code. It will automatically create and open the file without you needing to leave the keyboard.\nHere's what the code generation dialog looks like:\n\nAt the time of writing this article, there are options for generating 34 different files, including:\nControllers\nForm requests\nEloquent model casts\nService providers\nAnd so on.\nWhen generating each of these files, Laravel Idea provides you with additional options that are applicable to the file you're creating. For example, when generating a database migration, you will be provided with options such as:\nThe migration file name\nWhether the migration should create a table or change a table\nThe table name\nWhether the migration should be anonymous\nWhether to omit the \"down\" method from the migration\nAfter submitting the form, it will then automatically generate the database migration file for you. The database migration form looks like so:\n\nIf we were to submit this form, Laravel Idea would generate a new migration file (in the database/migrations directory) that looks something like this:\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Migrations\\Migration;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Schema\\Blueprint;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;\n\nreturn new class extends Migration {\n    public function up(): void\n    {\n        Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {\n            $table->id();\n\n\n\n            $table->timestamps();\n        });\n    }\n\n    public function down(): void\n    {\n        Schema::dropIfExists('articles');\n    }\n};\n\nGenerating Eloquent Models\nOne particular type of class generation that I love (and felt needed its own section in this article because I love it so much!), is the ability to generate Eloquent models.\nLaravel Idea provides you with a form that almost supercharges your ability to create models. Not only does it allow you to create the model class itself easily, but it can also automatically create several other related files at the same time and pre-fill some of them.\nYou can open the generator by navigating to the \"Laravel\" menu item and then clicking \"New Eloquent Model\".\nHere's an example of what the form looks like:\n\nAs we can see in the image, it gives you the ability to define the model name, table name, and all the fields you need. When adding the fields, you can choose their data type (e.g. - string, boolean, integer, etc.) and can also specify whether they're nullable. You can also define relationship fields (such as user_id and team_id in our example above). Laravel Idea will automatically suggest the related model class for you and will also add the relationship methods to the model.\nThe form also provides us with the ability to make the model soft-deletable, which will automatically add the deleted_at field to the new database table and register the Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\SoftDeletes trait in the model itself.\nAs well as the model, we can automatically generate the following related classes via this form:\nDatabase migration to create the table\nDatabase factory\nJSON resource (for use in APIs)\nController\nForm request\nPolicy\nBased on the form in our screenshot, we've opted to create the model, migration, policy, and controller. Let's take a look at what these generated files might look like, starting with the model:\nnamespace App\\Models;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Model;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\BelongsTo;\n\nclass Article extends Model\n{\n    protected function casts(): array\n    {\n        return [\n            'published_at' => 'timestamp',\n        ];\n    }\n    \n    public function user(): BelongsTo\n    {\n        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);\n    }\n\n    public function team(): BelongsTo\n    {\n        return $this->belongsTo(Team::class);\n    }\n}\n\nIn the code example above, we can see that a new App\\Models\\Article model has been created. Since we added relation fields (user_id and team_id), Laravel Idea has automatically created the user() and team() methods for us. It's also added the casts for the published_at field.\nNext, let's take a look at the generated migration file:\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Migrations\\Migration;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Schema\\Blueprint;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;\n\nreturn new class extends Migration {\n    public function up(): void\n    {\n        Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {\n            $table->id();\n            $table->string('uuid');\n            $table->foreignId('user_id');\n            $table->foreignId('team_id');\n            $table->string('title');\n            $table->text('content');\n            $table->timestamp('published_at');\n            $table->timestamps();\n        });\n    }\n\n    public function down(): void\n    {\n        Schema::dropIfExists('articles');\n    }\n};\n\nAs we can see, the migration file has been created with all the fields we specified in the form. You may want to make some changes to this file, such as adding indexes or cascading deletes. But if not, you can just run the migration as it is.\nNext, let's take a look at the generated policy file:\nnamespace App\\Policies;\n\nuse App\\Models\\Article;\nuse App\\Models\\User;\nuse Illuminate\\Auth\\Access\\HandlesAuthorization;\n\nclass ArticlePolicy\n{\n    use HandlesAuthorization;\n\n    public function viewAny(User $user): bool\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public function view(User $user, Article $article): bool\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function create(User $user): bool\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function update(User $user, Article $article): bool\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function delete(User $user, Article $article): bool\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function restore(User $user, Article $article): bool\n    {\n    }\n\n    public function forceDelete(User $user, Article $article): bool\n    {\n    }\n}\n\nAs we can see, the policy has all the methods we need to control access to the App\\Models\\Article model. You can then fill in the logic for each of these methods as needed.\nFinally, let's take a look at the generated controller file:\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse App\\Models\\Article;\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\Access\\AuthorizesRequests;\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\n\nclass ArticleController extends Controller\n{\n    use AuthorizesRequests;\n\n    public function index()\n    {\n        $this->authorize('viewAny', Article::class);\n\n        return Article::all();\n    }\n\n    public function store(Request $request)\n    {\n        $this->authorize('create', Article::class);\n\n        $data = $request->validate([\n            'uuid' => ['required'],\n            'user_id' => ['required', 'exists:users'],\n            'team_id' => ['required', 'exists:teams'],\n            'title' => ['required'],\n            'content' => ['required'],\n            'published_at' => ['required', 'date'],\n        ]);\n\n        return Article::create($data);\n    }\n\n    public function show(Article $article)\n    {\n        $this->authorize('view', $article);\n\n        return $article;\n    }\n\n    public function update(Request $request, Article $article)\n    {\n        $this->authorize('update', $article);\n\n        $data = $request->validate([\n            'uuid' => ['required'],\n            'user_id' => ['required', 'exists:users'],\n            'team_id' => ['required', 'exists:teams'],\n            'title' => ['required'],\n            'content' => ['required'],\n            'published_at' => ['required', 'date'],\n        ]);\n\n        $article->update($data);\n\n        return $article;\n    }\n\n    public function destroy(Article $article)\n    {\n        $this->authorize('delete', $article);\n\n        $article->delete();\n\n        return response()->json();\n    }\n}\n\nThe API controller has all the methods we need to interact with the App\\Models\\Article model and each method has some basic authorisation and validation checks in place. You'll likely want to add more logic to these methods, but this is a great starting point and saves you from having to write all the boilerplate code yourself.\nNavigation\nAnother really handy feature in Laravel Idea is how much it improves the navigation in PhpStorm.\nA standard feature in most IDEs is the ability to \"click-through/into\" a class name or method/function name and be taken to that class, method, or function. As you can imagine, this is really useful when navigating around your projects and wanting to see how a specific method works.\nHowever, Laravel Idea takes this a step further.  It provides you with the ability to click through to a lot more than just the standard classes and methods. You can also click through:\nConfig and translation keys - Example: Clicking through config('app.name') would take you directly to the name field in the config/app.php file.\nEloquent scopes and relation methods - Example: Clicking through the posts part of User::whereHas('posts') would take you to where the posts relation is defined in the User model.\nRoutes - Example: Clicking through route('dashboard') would take you to the route definition (presumably in the routes/web.php file).\nConsole commands - Example: Clicking through Artisan::call('migrate') would take you to the migrate command definition in vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Console/Migrations/MigrateCommand.php.\nAnd many more\n\n\nThe general rule of thumb is that if Laravel Idea can auto-complete the string for you when you're typing, it knows where that string is from and can take you directly to it.\nBeing able to jump around your code like this is much more efficient than having to manually search for the file or class you're looking for. It's a real time-saver!\nIntegrations and Package Support\nA really cool feature that I only recently discovered is how well Laravel Idea integrates with other packages and libraries, such as Livewire, Inertia, Laravel Nova, and Filament.\nFor example, if you're creating a Livewire or Inertia component, Laravel Idea can provide you with auto-complete suggestions, and allow you to quickly jump around your codebase.\nIf you're using something like Laravel Nova or Filament, you can also quickly generate Nova and Filament resource classes, even from existing Eloquent models. You can choose to generate these classes directly from the model by right-clicking on the model name (like shown in the image below), or via a new checkbox that appears in the \"Create Eloquent Model\" modal that we discussed earlier.\n\nConclusion\nIn this article, we've covered some of my favourite Laravel Idea features. As you can see, it's a great addition to PhpStorm that can make the IDE even more powerful than it already is.\nIf you're a Laravel developer, I highly recommend giving it a try, especially since there's a free trial available. It's a great tool that can save you a lot of time and make your development process much smoother.\nDid I miss any of your favourite Laravel Idea features?\nThe post Supercharge PhpStorm with Laravel Idea appeared first on Laravel News.\nJoin the Laravel Newsletter to get Laravel articles like this directly in your inbox.","pubDate":"2024-10-09"},{"title":"Laravel 11.27 Released","link":"https://laravel-news.com/laravel-11-27-0","description":"This week, the Laravel team released v11.27, with a configurable default currency in the Number helper, a Str::doesntContain() method, Schema::hasTable() performance improvements, and more.\nGlobally Change the Default Currency of the Number Helper\nRyan Holton contributed a configurable default currency setting for the Number helper. The USD currency setting is still the default, but now you can define a different default without using the in argument to override:\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Number;\n\n// Set the default currency\nNumber::useCurrency('EUR');\n\n$currency = Number::currency(1000); \n// ‚Ç¨1,000.00\n\n$currency = Number::currency(1000, in: 'USD');\n// $1,000.00\n\n// Some code that uses USD and defaults back to EUR after\nNumber::withCurrency('USD', function () {\n    //\n});\n\nYou can see the example output with this Tinkerwell session:\n\nString doesntContain() method\nRyan Holton contributed a doesntContain() method to the Str helper, which is the inverse of the contains() method:\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Str;\n\n$str = 'My favorite food is Pizza';\n\nStr::doesntContain($str, 'Steak'); // true\nStr::doesntContain($str, 'Pizza'); // false\nStr::doesntContain($str, ['Steak', 'Spaghetti']); // true\nStr::doesntContain($str, [\"Steak\", \"Spaghetti\", \"Pizza\"]); // false\n\nYou can see the example output with this Tinkerwell session:\n\nImprove Schema::hasTable() Performance\nHafez Divandari contributed a performance update to the Schema::hasTable() method:\nThe Schema::hasTable() method is using the Schema::getTable() method internally, which could sometimes result in an expensive query. This PR improves the performance of Schema::hasTable() by using more lightweight queries.\nAdd Extension Support to Str::inlineMarkdown()\nRyan Chandler added markdown extension support to the Str::inlineMarkdown() and str()->inlineMarkdown() methods, matching the update in Laravel 11.14 to add extension support to the markdown() method.\nHTTP Kernel Methods to Append Middleware Relative to Other Middleware\nOllie Read contributed an update to the HTTP Kernel that allows programmatic insertion of the middleware in relation to existing middleware in the priority stack. Specifically, it introduces two new public methods:\naddToMiddlewarePriorityAfter(): inserts middleware after specified middleware.\naddToMiddlewarePriorityBefore(): inserts middleware before specified middleware.\nThese changes make it easier for package developers to manage middleware priority without requiring user intervention.\nHere are two examples from the pull request description:\n$kernel->addToMiddlewarePriorityAfter(\n    \\Illuminate\\Routing\\Middleware\\ValidateSignature::class,\n    [\n        \\Illuminate\\Cookie\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\n        \\Illuminate\\Contracts\\Auth\\Middleware\\AuthenticatesRequests::class,\n    ],\n);\n\n$kernel->addToMiddlewarePriorityBefore(\n    \\Illuminate\\Routing\\Middleware\\ValidateSignature::class,\n    [\n        \\Illuminate\\Cookie\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\n        \\Illuminate\\Contracts\\Auth\\Middleware\\AuthenticatesRequests::class,\n    ],\n);\n\nRelease notes\nYou can see the complete list of new features and updates below and the diff between 11.26.0 and 11.27.1 on GitHub.

Similar to npx for npm, cpx allows you to run any command from a Composer package, even if it's not installed in your project.\nSay goodbye to version conflicts and installation hassles. cpx takes care of package installations and updates behind the scenes, letting you focus on what matters - coding. This ensures consistency across your projects, whether you're working solo or collaborating in a team.\nTo install cpx you do so using composer:\ncomposer global require cpx/cpx\n\nThen, you execute any composer package by doing:\ncpx vendor/package <command>\n\nFor example:\ncpx laravel/installer new\n \n# Or, for popular packages, you can use the command's alias directly\n \ncpx laravel new\n\n\nIf you switch between numerous projects, they may use different tooling and so cpx will help to normalize your workflow by providing commands that actually detect what tools your project is using and uses the correct one for you. Are you working on a project that uses Pests for testing? No problem! cpx automatically detects your project's testing framework (including PHPUnit or Codeception) and runs the appropriate tests with cpx test. Similar logic applies to static analysis with cpx check, which detects PHPStan, Psalm, or Phan, and code formatting with cpx format, which works with PHP-CS-Fixer, Laravel Pint, or PHPCBF.\ncpx also integrates nicely with Laravel and so your app will be bootstrapped so you can use any Laravel service.\nLearn more about this tool at cpx.dev and view the source code on GitHub.\nThe post Composer Package Executor (CPX) - bring NPX to Composer appeared first on Laravel News.\nJoin the Laravel Newsletter to get Laravel articles like this directly in your inbox.","pubDate":"2024-10-07"},{"title":"Optimize Your SQLite Database with the Laravel Optimize DB Package","link":"https://laravel-news.com/optimize-db-for-laravel-sqlite","description":"The Laravel Optimize DB package provides a good starting point for production-ready SQLite databases.

It allows the database to handle many reads simultaneously while still maintaining atomicity and durability for writes.\nUse case: Great for databases with mixed read/write workloads and high concurrency requirements.\n‚†Äcache_size = -20000 (20 MB cache):\nWhy it‚Äôs beneficial: Increasing the cache size helps store more pages in memory, reducing the need for disk I/O. This is especially useful for databases that are read frequently or have hot data. A larger cache means fewer page reads from disk, resulting in faster query responses.\nUse case: Important when dealing with large datasets and you have sufficient memory resources available.\n‚†Ämmap_size = 2147483648 (2 GB memory mapping):\nWhy it‚Äôs beneficial: Memory-mapping the database file can dramatically improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with file system operations. It allows the database to access data directly in memory, bypassing the need for repeated system calls to read or write data.\nUse case: Very beneficial for large databases on systems with ample memory, where file access speed is a priority.\nThe package is considered a work-in-progress, so use it carefully. The package advises not to use it in production yet and to back up your database before requiring it.
